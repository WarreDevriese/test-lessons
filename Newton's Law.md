# Simple Physics Lesson: Newton's Second Law

## Introduction
Newton's Second Law of Motion states that the acceleration of an object is dependent upon two variables - the net force acting upon the object and the mass of the object.

## The Law
The second law is often stated as:
$$ F = ma $$

Where:
- **F** is the force applied to the object,
- **m** is the mass of the object,
- **a** is the acceleration of the object.

## Conclusion
This law helps us understand how much force is needed to move an object at a given acceleration.
